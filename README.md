# Cloud-SOC-Automation

## Objective

This Cloud-Based SOC Automation project allowed me to set up a Cloud Based system utilizing tools like Wazuh, TheHive, Shuffler, and Sysmon on Vultr to detect, analyze, and Automate alerts, with the goal of setting up an environment to analyze how a SIEM agent like Wazuh can detect Mimikatz on a system. This project allowed me to understand how companies can decrease Incident response time based on the 
### Skills Learned


- Implementation and deployment of Cloud-Based Servers to house active tools
- Strengthen proficiency in maintaining a safe and separated environment from the host system
- Gained a deeper understanding on utilizing API keys to connect Security devices in Shuffler to create an automatic emailer.
- Enhanced knowledge utilizing SIEMs and Automation knowledge to lessen the burden of manually finding what threats are occurring on a system.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving in terms of recognizing how these systems help and increase productivity for Cyber Professionals.
### Tools Used

- Cloud-based environment builders like Vultr, AWS, and Azure to build within the cloud, as most companies have moved to today.
- Case management like TheHive which incorporates alot of tools to ensure all aspects like Metrics, Alerts, Case reporting are available for cyber teams.
- Telemetry generation tools like Sysmon to help analyze the Windows traffic that Mimikatz produces and ensure that it is capture by our SIEM
- A Security Information Event Management System like Wazuh that you create an agent in to help detect data and sends it to other tools to then be scanned and identified.
